# Hyper-V runners

Connections, machine names, workspaces and tools are selected through
[local runner configuration](runner-configuration.md). The helper supports
direct SSH or an optional VM discovery command, with one persistent Sevenzip
worktree per Git branch on each platform. Run IDs identify logs, not new source/build directories.
Historical installation records are linked from the archive; use local
configuration for the identities and paths of your installation.

For local linked worktrees, invoke the runner script in the feature worktree.
It transfers that worktree's current source and uses its branch for the remote
directory/lock. Private configuration, local run reports and shared tool/compiler
caches are resolved from the main checkout's harness;
see [configuration](runner-configuration.md) and
[feature worktree rules](../AGENTS.md#feature-worktrees-and-shared-harness).

## Persistent worktree

Synchronize local code into a persistent guest directory and reuse its build
outputs; do not create per-run build directories. Branch isolation (user request,
2026-10-24) replaces the former single shared directory. The global runners
skill's default fresh-directory workflow does not apply.

The selected workspace root contains a persistent source directory for each Git branch.
Tools, caches, dependencies, runtime, outputs, native build intermediates,
temporary files and local source staging use the ordinary disk by default.
An optional RAM workspace can be selected through the
[storage settings](runner-configuration.md#connections-and-tools).
Only the branch
name selects the directory; local checkout paths do not affect it. Different
branches can run concurrently; runs of the same branch share a lock even from
different local directories. Switch to a named branch before running from a
detached HEAD. The selected branch and remote directory appear in console output
and run reports. Preserve branch worktrees, incremental outputs, compiler caches
and active locks. The first run of each branch creates its own build tree while
reusing the project compiler cache. Branch directory names use reversible
escaping for special characters without adding hashes.

Before transfer, an atomic sibling `.lock` directory reserves the entire cycle,
including synchronization, build/tests and log retrieval. A second invocation
fails with the owner run ID before touching source. An existing nonempty
worktree without the project ownership marker is refused.

cp2 reconciles an immutable local
copy of the current worktree. It includes modified tracked files and nonignored
new files in the allowlisted source/resource/test/doc/script directories and
top-level build configuration. Translation catalogs travel with the application
sources so localized checks use the same build inputs on every platform.
Deleted files disappear remotely. No staging or
commit is required. Local `.git`, `.codex`, credentials, build outputs and other
ignored state are not sent. Existing build outputs, prepared dependencies,
reports and runner control files are protected from deletion.
Unsafe external source links are refused.
cp2 checks and reconciles the supplied files; there is no additional source
hash pass. The source copy describes code at invocation start, not edits made during the run.
Matching files are skipped, including on repeated runs. Linux permissions and
relative source links are preserved; Windows omits Unix permission replication.
Edits made while an earlier snapshot builds still trigger compilation on the
next run. Repeated runs preserve incremental outputs. Tool installation and caches
are described in [configuration](runner-configuration.md#source-synchronization).

After confirmed command exit the lock is released, including on a normal test
failure. An interrupted or disconnected invocation retains it if execution
completion is unknown. Interrupting the client is not guaranteed cancellation
of guest processes. Inspect with:

```sh
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py status all
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py recover windows
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py status all --branch feature/example
```

`recover` only releases the recorded owner's lock when its completion marker
matches. It never steals a live/unknown lock. If synchronization or the shell
died before writing completion, inspect guest processes, scheduled tasks and
the recorded owner before manually releasing that exact abandoned lock; age
alone is insufficient. The next normal sync repairs a partial source transfer.
`status` and `recover` default to the current branch; `--branch` selects another
branch without switching local source.

## Storage policy (user instruction, 2026-10-07)

Do not create or attach new virtual disks, including VHD/VHDX files, to solve
capacity problems. Do not grow disks, repartition or reformat volumes without
a separate user request. Use the existing configured volumes; the historical
data-disk creation recorded in the archive is not authorization to repeat it.

Before each new validation batch, inspect completed runs and remove obsolete
Sevenzip Desktop run payloads, build outputs and temporary data under the
retention rules below, even when space is sufficient. Before substantial builds,
also check current free space on the host and selected guest volume; measure
again after cleanup. This project
cleanup is explicitly authorized by the user and takes precedence over the
global runners skill's default restriction on automatic deletion for warnings.
It does not authorize compaction or VM storage reconfiguration.

Identify completed runs from their metadata and check running processes,
interactive scheduled tasks and workspace references before deleting anything.
Keep the three newest runs per project workspace, every active or referenced
run (including delta bases in use), and artifacts needed for current review
or failure diagnosis. In older inactive runs, retain small logs and metadata;
remove reproducible source snapshots, runtime/build trees and run-local temp
files. Apply this to configured project workspaces. Preserve
toolchains, installed build/synchronization tools, other projects and unrelated data.
Record removed paths and free space before/after. If safely removable data is
insufficient, report the remaining capacity requirement; do not add a disk.

## Runner configuration and evidence

Run reports include the time from local script invocation to the first CTest
test starting, with lower/upper bounds for SSH clock correlation. This uses
monotonic clocks and does not require synchronized wall clocks. The marker is
recorded when the wrapper receives CTest's first `Start` line; listing tests or
failing before execution does not produce a test-start measurement.
Reports separate local source preparation, readiness, workspace checks/locking,
transfer and remote execution. Focused `verify.py` runs additionally record
guest runtime preparation, configuration, target discovery, selection, build
and test durations and milestones. Missing stages are not reported as zero.
Timing is diagnostic: unavailable measurements do not change the command result
or prevent collection of its log and verification report.
The command log, timing data and verification report return together in one
compressed SSH response. Missing optional reports are recorded independently;
a verification report is accepted only for the current run.

`CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` is forwarded to guest builds when set to a positive
integer. Use `1` when a guest runs out of memory during compilation; this
retains its incremental build and compiler cache.

Linux and Windows runs use the same light diagnostic defaults as local builds;
[development](development.md#build-diagnostics) describes the optional modes,
individual diagnostics and compact test links. This reduces per-run artifacts;
historical completed snapshots still require the storage cleanup policy above.
Default runner gates also exclude tests labeled `slow`. Long suites require an
explicit request and opt-in as described in AGENTS.md; do not count excluded
matrices as platform acceptance.
The helper forwards `SEVENZIP_INCLUDE_SLOW_TESTS` (0 by default; only 0/1 are
accepted) to both guest environments. Prefix a specifically requested exhaustive
runner command with `SEVENZIP_INCLUDE_SLOW_TESTS=1` to opt in.

Runner script provenance is retained in the [dated environment record](archive/runner-environment-2026-10-18.md#runner-script-provenance).

For ordinary presets, runner selection sets `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and prepends the
kit and tool directories from local configuration. Manifest presets use
[vcpkg runner configuration](runner-configuration.md#connections-and-tools).
`probe` queries that kit's qmake rather than the system default. Install/select
the kit before checks; the helper does not download Qt or change global PATH.
Use `probe` to confirm the live kit; prior probe/gate results are
[historical evidence](archive/qt-port/workflow-evidence.md).

The persistent worktree contains `runner-tmp`. Its process environment sets
`TEMP`, `TMP` and `TMPDIR` there before MSVC setup and the interactive child.
Temporary files stay in the project workspace and are excluded from source synchronization.
This does not change global environment variables, move old files or delete
completed runs; capacity still needs a live preflight before substantial builds.
Linux SSH checks default `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` to `offscreen` when it is unset;
an explicit platform selection and per-suite CTest overrides are retained.

### Workspace and Linux data volume

The local configuration explicitly selects each workspace. An optional Linux
mount/UUID pair is checked before acquiring the worktree or transferring source;
a missing or different mount fails without falling back to another disk.
See [configuration and migration](runner-configuration.md). The helper does not
create, format or mount disks. Prior mount setup and capacity samples remain
[historical evidence](archive/qt-port/history/hyperv-runner-evidence.md).

```sh
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py probe linux
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py probe windows
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py probe all
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py check linux
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py check windows
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py check all
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py run all -- scripts/build.sh release
```

Native Windows window/focus/Properties checks need the logged-on user's desktop,
not SSH's session0. Use `check windows --interactive`, `check all --interactive`,
or `run windows --interactive -- <project-script> [args]`. The runner creates a
unique `Sevenzip-check-...` scheduled task with the current runner identity and
an InteractiveToken, runs the worktree's `check.cmd`/toolchain there, records
the session and exit code, then removes the completed task. It needs an existing
active runner logon; it does not log in, supply credentials or fall back to a
noninteractive desktop. Linux in `all` keeps its normal path. Session0 runs may
verify backend/COM data consumers, but hidden windows do not prove UI acceptance.

The interactive task preserves its exit code and completion receipt independently
of the SSH observer. A disconnected or expired observer does not prove that the
task stopped. Check the owned task before recovery; after it finishes, its receipt
allows the existing lock recovery command to release the workspace.

Interactive tasks explicitly request Task Scheduler priority4 (normal process
priority); its default7 starts a background process and affects child fixtures.
The child records and verifies actual `Priority=Normal` before `check.cmd`, and
sets `SEVENZIP_RUNNER_EXPECT_NORMAL_PRIORITY=1` so `process_priority` also checks
the inherited CTest process context. This is scoped to the owned task, in both
Limited and Highest modes; it changes no global scheduler or account setting.
See [Microsoft's priority mapping](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/tasksettings-priority)
and the [native regression receipt](archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-03-runner-priority-2026-10-16.md).

The [service-desktop diagnosis](archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit.md#p3-03--windows-service-desktop-visibility-diagnosis-2026-10-10)
explains why hidden windows in session 0 cannot establish UI acceptance.

Full Windows gates also include privileged native symlink/security fixtures.
Use `check windows --interactive --elevated` or `check all --interactive --elevated`
for those gates; custom validation wrappers accept the same flags before `--`.
`--elevated` selects `Highest` for this invocation's owned scheduled task and checks
the actual administrator token before running the command. Session evidence
records requested run level and actual elevation. The default interactive mode
keeps `Limited`; noninteractive/Linux-only elevation requests are rejected.
No developer-mode, UAC, user-rights, account or machine policy is changed.

`native_menu_integration` exercises real per-user COM registration under an
ordinary user token. When privileged link/security fixtures require an elevated
parent gate, this test launches its own child using the desktop process as its
parent, following [Microsoft's parent-process API technique](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190425-00/?p=102443).
It first verifies the same user SID and session and an unelevated desktop token;
the child independently checks elevation before registration and activation.
The fixture waits for its child, reports its assertions and removes only registry
entries bearing that child's ownership marker. It changes no UAC/security policy,
uses no alternate credentials and retains the ordinary-token path for the default
interactive runner. Its required Vista API declarations apply only to this test.

The general entry point is `run <linux|windows|all> [runner-options] --
<project-script> [script-arguments]`. Examples:

```sh
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py run all -- scripts/check.sh
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py run linux -- scripts/build.sh dev
python3 scripts/hyperv-runner.py run all -- scripts/check_ui_parity.py --help
```

Scripts must be nonignored project files in the synced directories, with paths
relative to the project root. `.sh` uses Bash on both platforms (Git Bash on
Windows); `.py` uses the guest Python; `.ps1` is supported for Windows only.
PowerShell project scripts use process-scoped `RemoteSigned`, like the runtime
builders; the helper does not change machine/user execution-policy settings.
Arguments after `--` are passed literally, including spaces, Unicode and shell
metacharacters. Scripts run from the branch worktree in the existing platform
toolchain environment. Existing engine/SFX artifacts are reused by default.
Use `--prepare-runtime` to prepare or refresh them explicitly before a command.
Each action has its own `--help` and accepts only its applicable runner options.
`--preset` selects the runtime/build profile; `run` passes the command's build/test
options through the script arguments. `scripts/build.sh` takes `dev` or `release` positionally.
`check --preset release` runs the development gate followed by a Release build;
it does not run CTest against Release, where test targets are disabled.

The source transport is cp2 over the verified SSH connection, with
deletion/protection and locking as described [above](#persistent-worktree).
Scp retrieves logs.

cp2 is installed on demand as described in
[local configuration](runner-configuration.md#source-synchronization).
Windows builds use the configured Bash and MSVC tools. Prepare the other build
dependencies before checks.

`all` materializes current source once, then runs the two guests in
parallel. Failure on one guest does not prevent the other from completing.
The command exits nonzero if either fails. Each platform has `run.json`, a local
`transport.log`, and a downloaded full `check.log` when available under
`build/runners/hyperv/<run-id>/<platform>/`; the parent `run.json` records the
source revision, branch, command, phase timings and aggregate result. Failure
output includes the last 20 log lines with a platform prefix. Log retrieval
errors are recorded separately from script results.
`probe all` also checks both guests in parallel, printing each guest's captured
output as one block and returning nonzero if either probe fails. Preparation
errors captured by discovery are retained in the run record and transport log.

Every invocation reuses the selected branch/profile build tree. CTest still needs its targets
built after synchronization: use `verify.py`, or a script calling `build.sh`
followed by `ctest.sh`. There is no per-run build mode. Temporary local source
copies are removed after transfer/execution; only logs and metadata get run IDs.

An optional readiness command can start an existing VM, rediscover its address
and verify guest identity. The maintainer uses the separately installed runners
skill; direct SSH configurations do not require it. The helper uses the
configured SSH argument array and normal host-key verification. Keys and
credentials are never transferred.

## Source and runtime scope

Native desktop availability is separate from SSH readiness. Interactive checks
require an active desktop session as described above. Historical login and network
diagnoses are retained in the [environment record](archive/runner-environment-2026-10-18.md#desktop-and-network-recovery).

Each check updates the selected branch worktree. Source scope, untracked files
and exclusions are specified in [the synchronization contract](#persistent-worktree).

The helper includes the repository-owned source archives recorded in the
baselines. It does not create an upstream Git bundle or object store.
`prepare-runtime.py` verifies a toolchain/builder/source
fingerprint and artifact hashes before reusing the dynamic engine, codec module,
standalone client and SFX. Misses invoke the official project builders, which
retain their owned expanded source trees and incremental build outputs. All runtime binaries match
the guest architecture and pinned source. Environment changes are process-local.

Before transfer, the helper checks actual local staged/worktree diffs for
whitespace errors, as before. The guest runs the supplied checks without creating
or updating a Git repository for the project. Remote full gates retain formatting
checks and use the local whitespace result. Source inventory and revision metadata
travel with the snapshot for checks and review reports. The client's Git index is unchanged. Runtime
preparation and `scripts/check.sh` write to `check.log` in the guest directory.
Use the `dev` preset for tests and `run ... -- scripts/build.sh release` for
a Release build; the Release preset disables test targets. Connection records,
project revision, directory, preset and status stay in ignored
`build/runners/hyperv/` on the Mac. Local source/toolchain preparation failures
may occur before a remote run record exists. No automatic cleanup, VM creation,
package installation, shutdown or publishing is performed.

## Toolchains

Select installed Qt, compiler, formatter and build tools through
[local configuration](runner-configuration.md), and use `probe` to inspect the
selected kit. Install dependencies before running checks; the helper does not
provision toolchains. Linux builds need the dependencies listed in
[development](development.md). Historical kit versions and installation records
are retained in the [environment record](archive/runner-environment-2026-10-18.md#toolchain-installations).

Ccache is selected automatically by `build.sh` for C/C++ (and Objective-C++
where applicable). All runner checks, including full gates, follow the
[cache-preserving validation rules](../AGENTS.md#validation-scope); a full-check
request does not authorize clearing or bypassing ccache or recreating build trees.
Keep compiler caches outside the synchronized source tree and select their
paths through local configuration. MSVC uses embedded `/Z7` debug information
through CMake CMP0141 so cached objects retain debugging information.
Use a formatter compatible with the repository's formatting configuration,
in a separate tool environment when other projects require a different version.

`python3 scripts/verify.py tooling` runs the registered offline workflow, runner,
runtime-cache, memory setup, CTest selection and output suites. On Windows it also
checks reference-builder reuse/rebuild and refusal of unowned output using a
synthetic compiler fixture, without launching the actual native reference UI.
These checks cover a first build with
missing executables, fixture closure, incremental reuse, empty/slow selections,
Unicode/current/untracked/deleted source and protected
outputs, snapshot build freshness, lock ownership/completion and failure/context/quoting behavior. These
tests use temporary deterministic local fixtures and no VM/network access;
they require Bash, Git, CMake/Ninja and a compiler, plus Windows PowerShell
for the Windows builder fixture.

SSH checks cover the project gate, not interactive desktop/Finder behavior,
distribution or rendered Windows 7zFM parity. Historical ARM64 QEMU checks
are separate evidence and do not validate the current runners.

## Historical evidence

Early runner, entry-point and CLI checks are retained in
[the runner archive](archive/qt-port/history/hyperv-runner-evidence.md).
