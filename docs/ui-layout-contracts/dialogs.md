# Shared dialogs and operation feedback

[Все UI-спецификации](../ui-layout-contracts.md). Разделы сохраняют исходные требования,
якоря и границы датированных свидетельств. Новые результаты проверок —
в [source audit](../upstream-port-audit.md).

### Standard source dialog buttons (P3-05.9, accepted button scope)

Reference: pinned LangUtils.cpp::kLangPairs/LangSetDlgItems, GuiCommon.rc and
each dialog's resource/OnInit caller. Selected 7-Zip language controls OK,
Cancel, Yes, No, Close, Help and Continue. Missing entries keep the resource
caption; Memory uses IDCONTINUE. Hot reload preserves roles and pending input.
The approved redesign replaces generic OK with the result of Copy/Move/Combine,
Split and password Continue, using application catalogs and the same button role.
Options property-sheet/native dialogs retain their platform language owner.
`language_standard_buttons` checks twelve source consumers at their normal/
compact sizes below and produces48 EN/RU footer reports per platform. Reports on all three platforms reviewed
2026-10-06 show visible, separate standard controls and exact source captions;
rendered Windows parity and parent/final acceptance remain pending.

### Shared ListView: Properties and Folder History (P3-06)

Reference: pinned FileManager/ListViewDialog.rc and OnInit/OnEnter/OnOK callers.
The approved redesign uses the shared dialog layout and native content-sized
buttons. Reports have Copy/Close; Folder History has Open/Cancel. Preserve
one-column hidden History header and the blank, resizable two-column Properties
header. Copy uses the full selected values, or all rows when nothing is selected;
an empty report cannot overwrite the clipboard. Native button ordering is retained.
`list_view_dialog` writes EN/RU
source-initial and540×360/360×240 reports, checking exposed list/footer without
changing stored full values, clipboard/detail or acceptance behavior.

### Link (P2-05)

Reference: pinned FileManager/LinkDialog.rc and source OnInit/OnButton_Link.
Initial size follows visible controls and native minima. Root/footer use the
shared redesigned dialog layout;
Browse is20DLU wide. Empty Current target text reserves no row, and native
spacing separates paths and Link Type. The footer uses a native QDialogButtonBox
with content-sized Create link/Cancel actions.
The source resizable/minimize/maximize capabilities are requested through Qt
window flags; native window managers may suppress modal title-bar controls.
The resource has no context-help title-bar button.
Link from combo/browse precedes Link to combo/browse and current target text.
Link Type contains Hard→File Symbolic→Directory Symbolic→Junction→WSL in source
order. Create link is the default footer button; button ordering follows the
platform. Qt scrolls the
content when necessary; requested compact sizes expand to show the path inputs
and all link choices. Desktop-only Junction/WSL remain visibly disabled on
POSIX with a platform reason. Source radio/type choices and errors remain owned
by CLinkDialog; Qt controls bind original captions and LangSetDlgItems maps
IDCANCEL to its source language entry.
Radio captions use the existing220-pixel language wrapping binding so native
Windows EN/RU font metrics do not force horizontal clipping at360 pixels.
`link_dialog` writes EN/RU520×500/360×300 JSON and checks named controls after
scrolling and footer exposure, plus native-font initial frames. Review captures
return to the top after reachability probes. Historical native EN/RU reports and
rendered original initial states are recorded in the
[secondary-dialog receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-secondary-dialogs-2026-10-16.md).
Native font metrics, compact scrolling and modal chrome prevent a claim of
complete rendered Windows pixel equality.

### Benchmark (P2-04)

Reference: pinned `CPP/7zip/UI/GUI/BenchmarkDialog.rc` and its source state bodies.
POSIX failed/empty affinity uses original System.h normalized processor fallback
in the hardware-threads leading CPU count and choice limits; that count must not
be zero or retain InitST's one when a larger processor count is available.
Windows retains its native source helper. These system failures do not change
grouping or controls.
Dictionary/memory precede CPU threads, then Size→Speed→CPU Usage→Rating / Usage→
Rating columns; Compressing and Decompressing retain Current/Resulting rows.
Elapsed/Passes and Total Rating precede CPU/version/system information. In the
normal resource, Restart/Stop belong to the upper right of the left control
pane; Help/Cancel remain in that pane's footer. The separate static log begins
at the top of the right column when nonempty. An empty log reserves no column,
allowing metrics to use the available width. It uses
plain, nonwrapping dialog-font text, not the total mode's fixed-font edit.
Compressing/Decompressing are group boxes; resource RTEXT metric headers and
values are right-aligned. Initial clients are488×264DLU normal and376×276DLU
total, with Qt font/minimum-size protection. Current tests assert these initial
frames, roles/grouping, footer placement, right alignment and logical focus.
Source normal logical tab order is Restart→Stop→Help→Cancel→Dictionary→Threads→
Passes, with Restart initially focused. Total initially focuses its console.
Both source templates request minimize/maximize/resizable style and no
context-help title-bar button; Qt retains native modal-chrome conventions.
Total mode has elapsed time and a fixed-font console. Qt scrolls the normal control pane at
compact heights and protects the minimum width needed by its metrics. System
information wraps in the available column width, with a gutter beside overlay
scrollbars. Qt replaces Win32 rectangles/font setup with Qt layout services.

`benchmark_lifecycle` writes source-initial and normal/total EN/RU JSON at960×650 and640×400,
checks all named labels/inputs after scrolling, fixed footer exposure and live
language changes. Historical reports on all three OS were reviewed2026-10-03: normal compact
controls scroll vertically/horizontally, metrics captions fit; buttons remain
fully exposed. Total console is618×326 compact and938×576 normal. Cancel/Help use
the original standard language mapping402/409; control IDs2/9 are not language
IDs. No screenshot or rendered Windows reference has been used to claim pixel
parity. Windows spanning group/error/system labels retain natural width; wrapped
source text updates also set its required height, since a grid span's height
calculation otherwise assumes the wider span. The Windows console is618×332
compact/938×582normal; Linux618×330/938×580. Lower system rows are expected below
the initial compact viewport and are tested after scrolling. Current Windows
960×650 reports also leave3px of the empty final SYS2 row below the initial
viewport; its label fits and the same per-control scrolling check verifies
reachability. This is scroll-content geometry, not clipped text. P2-04 acceptance
is recorded in the audit; whole-plan platform/rendered checks remain P3.
The current source-frame/grouping correction has36 native JSON per OS and ten
original Windows EN/RU reference states across List/Link/Benchmark. See the
[current receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-secondary-dialogs-2026-10-16.md)
for precise checks and deviations; the older console dimensions above retain
their historical revision.

## Commands and reports

## Folder history list

Reference: `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
`CPP/7zip/UI/FileManager/ListViewDialog.rc/.cpp` and
`PanelFolderChange.cpp::CPanel::FoldersHistory`.
The single-column list fills the resizable body; Open/Cancel sit below it.
It uses the shared dialog layout and native content-sized buttons. Native button
ordering is retained. Source minimize/maximize/resizable capabilities are
requested with Qt flags; no context-help title-bar button is added.
There is no separate Delete button in the reference. Delete affects all
selected rows, Ctrl+A/C copy/select, Enter confirms the focused path.
Long paths remain reachable through scrolling, without eliding stored text.
SingleClick changes activation to one click and enables hover selection without
confirmation. Modified selection clicks do not activate. Interaction coverage
is in `list_activation`. Cancel leaves stored history unchanged; Open retains
the source history update and focused-path navigation.
`folder_history` verifies list/footer visibility and separation at 540×360
and 360×240 and writes JSON reports. Qt geometry establishes structure and
usability. The original rendered EN/RU history states are recorded in the
[secondary-dialog receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-secondary-dialogs-2026-10-16.md);
widget geometry does not establish pixel equivalence or physical input.

## Hash results

The native HashGUI result presenter uses the same ListViewDialog resource and
two-column property/value body. Its title is «Контрольные суммы»; source bundle
rows include the filename, byte size and requested digest. It starts without
selected rows and retains the native DeleteIsAllowed flag. Copy/Close remain
below the list, using the shared report layout and full-value copy behavior.
`hash_results` checks exact source-generated rows against a
CRC32 fixture, title/state and unclipped, separate list/footer/buttons at
540×360 and 420×360; reports are `hash-results-540`/`hash-results-420`.
Horizontal scrolling remains available for long Unicode names/values. This
checks Qt structure/usability, not rendered Windows pixel parity. The complete
hash command/file workflow is connected and accepted in P2-03. PanelCrc and
HashCalcGUI invoke this same source presenter; current540/420 JSON reviewed
2026-10-03, macOS full gate199/199 and Windows13/Linux focused consumers passed.

## Full text detail

Reference: EditDialog.rc; source scope and baseline are recorded in the
[properties audit](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit.md#свойства-и-двухколоночный-список-2026-09-28).
CEditDialog uses the shared redesigned dialog layout and native button sizes.
It requests the source resize/minimize/maximize capabilities without a title-bar
context-help button. CEditDialog has one read-only multiline
edit above Copy/Close, with both scroll directions and no automatic wrapping.
Its system monospaced font preserves the dialog text size. Copy uses selected
text, or the full text when nothing is selected, without closing the dialog.
Text/Title are copied without truncation. Close has initial focus and is the
default button: initial Enter closes. Tab reaches the edit, where Enter remains
inside the edit (ES_WANTRETURN). Tab then reaches Copy and Close.
Geometry: 480×320 and 320×240,
visible, separate text area and footer. Coverage is described in
[testing](../testing.md). Rendered Windows parity remains unverified.

## Selected properties

Window Properties now reads the bound source folder/operated indices. File
packed size is visible for filesystem and archive owners; empty source values
are omitted. Rows follow the source property catalog, with the existing full
current-location footer. Archive Modified text remains sparse raw compatibility
data until native time parsing; it is not a precision/timezone acceptance claim.

Reference: ListViewDialog.rc; source scope and baseline are recorded in the
[properties audit](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit.md#свойства-и-двухколоночный-список-2026-09-28).
Two columns (property/value) fill the body with a visible empty header,
followed by OK/Cancel. No label form or custom selection title remains.
The same496×336DLU source frame and native-font/margin/footer policy as folder
history apply; header visibility remains controlled by NumColumns.
The value shown in the list is limited to 1024 upstream wchar_t units,
then ` ...`; CRLF/LF become spaces. Copy and Enter/double-click detail
use the full value. Delete is disabled for properties.
Geometry: list/header/footer at 540×360 and 360×240, long Unicode paths and
horizontal scrolling. Test coverage is described in [testing](../testing.md).
`panel_property` writes `typed-properties-540` and `typed-properties-360` reports
with source typed maximum-size and multiline error values. List/header/footer
remain visible and separated; names/values remain two columns, long values use
the existing source truncation/detail contract and error LF displays as spaces.
Only structural Qt usability is verified; a rendered Windows reference
was unavailable.

`properties_runtime` produces `properties-runtime-flat*-mode*-*.json`,
`properties-directory-flat*-mode*-*.json` and
`properties-summary-flat*-mode*-*.json` for file, directory and aggregate states
in all normal/flat/four-view combinations at 540×360 and 360×240. The same list,
empty two-column header and separate visible OK/Cancel footer apply to each.

## GUI early error messages

The standard early GUI errors have no custom upstream dialog resource:
UpdateGUI::ShowDialog and ExtractGUI call Explorer/MyMessages' MessageBox
presentation. `gui_error_policy` checks the corresponding Qt Critical/OK boxes
at requested 480×220/320×160 in EN/RU, including fitted message labels and visible
OK controls; each of the six visible states emits two current-build JSON reports.
Suppressed states emit no box. Qt owns any minimum size adjustment and native
button placement; macOS omits the window caption. The original hardcoded English
texts remain unchanged. This is a standard message adaptation, not rendered
Windows pixel parity or a contract for custom Extract/Compress dialog geometry.
Current macOS boxes auto-fit to 228/304×116, Linux to 204/274×98 and Windows to
293/400×96 for writer/output errors respectively. Both requested sizes resolve
to these platform sizes, with fitted labels and visible/enabled OK; the requested
compact width does not override QMessageBox's standard fit policy.

## Shared name/mask dialog

Reference: upstream `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
`CPP/7zip/UI/FileManager/ComboDialog.cpp/.rc` and
`BrowseDialog.cpp::Dlg_CreateFolder`. Implemented view: `ComboDialog.cpp`.

- The prompt precedes one editable combo, with OK/Cancel at the bottom.
  Initial Value remains visible after populating ordered Strings.
- The redesigned initial frame retains a font-scaled preferred width, while
  height follows the prompt, editable field and native actions. Long prompts
  can wrap and enlarge the minimum height. Explicit normal/compact resizing
  below remains a separate adaptation.
- Folder/file creation uses source title, prompt and default-name language IDs;
  selection masks use the same view with their own prompts.
- CPanel::SelectSpec owns the Select/Deselect titles, mask prompt, initial `*`
  and Cancel return. `source_selection` checks both languages/panes and standard/
  alternative marks, with32 current360×150/260×150 Combo reports. The same
  source owner handles an inactive-pane direct call without changing its peer.
- OnOK preserves raw text, including spaces and an empty value. Validation
  belongs to the calling operation. Cancel leaves the public Value unchanged.
- `combo_dialog` checks folder/file/mask views at 360×150 and 260×150:
  fitted prompt, reachable combo/footer, control order and separate buttons.
  JSON reports accompany the checks; screenshots remain optional.
- `source_create` exercises actual CreateFolder/CreateFile callers in both
  panes/languages and normal/flat views. Forty-eight current 360×150/260×150
  reports reuse this contract; creation keeps the source first-component focus,
  alternative marks and distinct failure-refresh policy. Cancel preserves the
  pre-dialog state. Source provenance and checks are in the
  [receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit.md#p3-05--source-create-filefolder-scenario-2026-10-10).
- ZIP comment uses source `PanelOperations.cpp::ChangeComment` with the focused
  item name and localized Comment in its title, localized IDS_COMMENT2 prompt
  and the existing raw property value. `native_comment_ui` checks EN/RU at the
  same two sizes: current comment-en/ru-360/260 JSON reports preserve prompt,
  editable combo and separately reachable OK/Cancel. titleID=0 preserves the
  caller's dynamic title; source language ID0 is the application name.
- Original Set Comment Error/HRESULT remains the error presentation. On macOS,
  which omits QMessageBox window captions, the caption is the visible message
  heading and HRESULT detail is informative text. Tests exercise real writer
  refusal on both languages and ordinary/AES ZIP. Comment now uses the shared
  source panel HRESULT/caption helper; its source-owned refresh follows the
  error, while dialog Cancel returns before refresh. Existing Combo JSON and
  normal/compact geometry consumers retain the same controls and text contract.
- Filesystem comments use the same source dialog, focused name/title and
  IDS_COMMENT2 prompt. `filesystem_comment` checks existing value, EN/RU,
  normal360×150/compact260×150, File Comment and Ctrl+Z, OK and Escape, selected
  rows and unchanged file bytes. Eight filesystem-comment-en/ru-0/1-360/260 JSON
  show a fitted prompt, editable combo and separately visible/enabled OK/Cancel.
  The source FSFolder writer trims the accepted comment; ZIP's raw whitespace
  behavior remains separate. No new dialog or rendered Windows parity is claimed.
  The source Escape/Cancel path does not reload the folder. An externally added
  item while the dialog is open remains unpublished until explicit Refresh;
  selection, focus, provider and peer rows stay intact. Accepted Comment reaches
  the source reload phase even after operation failure. Load failure/cancellation
  leaves no stale rows and releases guards; a later explicit Refresh recovers.
  Preserve the original ignored reload-result policy in this operation caller.
  Inspect both panes in EN/RU at 980×620/640×400 after Cancel and terminal load.

Qt layouts replace OnSize. Plain-text wrapping handles Qt label rendering;
the native AddString behavior is adapted by restoring initial edit text after
Qt populates the combo. Windows rendering was unavailable; geometry establishes
structure/usability on the tested macOS Qt platform.

## Split and Combine dialogs

Reference: upstream `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
`CPP/7zip/UI/FileManager/SplitDialog.rc`, `SplitDialog.cpp::{OnInit, OnOK,
OnButtonSetPath}`, and `PanelSplitFile.cpp::CApp::Combine` with `CopyDialog.rc`.
Implemented views: `SplitDialog.cpp` and the existing `CopyDialog.cpp`.

- Split puts the destination label above its editable combo, with Browse on
  the right. The volume-size label and editable preset combo follow below.
  The source filename is appended to the window title, as in OnInit.
- The source initial client template is304×112DLU. The volume combo remains
  left-aligned at96DLU, including after resize; Browse uses20DLU width with a
  native minimum hit target and the source `...` caption. Only the destination
  combo expands horizontally.
  Font mapping and Qt minimum sizes protect labels/footer on each platform.
- OK/Cancel remain at the bottom. Invalid volume input opens the source
  Critical/7-Zip/OK modal message and keeps Split open, including accept().
  OK or Escape dismisses only the message; raw input remains available for retry.
- Combine uses the original shared Copy dialog: destination, Browse,
  read-only scrolling summary and footer. The summary lists the count and
  size, source prefix, first two names, ellipsis when needed and final name.
- `volume_dialog` checks normal/compact Split at 480×240 and 340×240 in
  normal/error states, and Combine at 480×250 and 340×250 with 2/3/5 parts.
  It writes JSON and verifies order, reachable controls, fitted labels,
  separated path/Browse and separate OK/Cancel.

Qt layouts replace OnSize arithmetic; Qt native folder browsing replaces
MyBrowseForFolder. The earlier inline-error adaptation is removed2026-10-10;
no extra error control exists in the source resource. Separate current-build
message JSON checks Critical/plain text/OK and native auto-fit; macOS ignores
its caption. `language_dialog` also checks English/Russian prompts and raw input
across language changes. Windows volume/language consumers use native QPA/fonts
and the existing UI resource lock. The original parser and partial-failure
vector remain authoritative; invalid submission starts no operation or directory.
Reports establish structure/usability on macOS; a rendered Windows reference
was unavailable and pixel-level parity remains unverified.

## Progress dialog and modal lifecycle

Reference: upstream `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
ProgressDialog2.rc/ProgressDialog2a.rc (`IDD_PROGRESS`) and the complete handlers
and statistic/message dependencies in ProgressDialog2.cpp. The approved redesign
shows status, progress bar and the two-line directory/name first, then elapsed,
remaining and the completed/total file count. Errors stay in the overview and an
independent two-column message list. Details reveals total/speed/processed/packed/
ratio in a label/value grid with right-aligned values. Background/Pause/Cancel
use the common footer with native button roles. Percentage belongs in the title;
hide text inside the bar.

Initially errors label/value/list are hidden. New messages show all three and
use source numbered first lines and unnumbered continuations; copy selected
rows or all rows if none selected. ShowCompressionInfo=false hides packed and
ratio labels/values inside Details. Collapsing Details does not stop statistics
updates, change pause or hide errors. Pause changes to
Continue, prefixes the title and freezes timer rendering/elapsed accumulation;
resume preserves elapsed time. Files-progress scales by count, while speed
remains byte based. Unknown totals clear size/remaining totals according to
the original cached state. Native endpoint/unknown/overflow behavior is retained.

Qt layouts and native size hints own geometry; source OnSize retains its
width-dependent string reduction. The overview/details area scrolls at compact
sizes; the error list and footer remain outside that viewport. Initial height
follows the collapsed content. Source NormalizeSize retains work-area protection.
Normal 760×450 and compact 640×380 geometry tests check collapsed/expanded states,
reachability, text/button fitting and footer/list separation. `ui_parity_progress` maps all
26 IDs to 24 JSON reports across compression/errors/paused, native priority and finish-Close
states. Captions follow source language bindings; clipboard shortcuts also accept macOS Meta.
Background is the source default button and receives initial focus when native
priority capability is available; Enter on focused Pause toggles pause instead.
Real priority failure restores the previous caption/title and reports a source
Sync error. Cancel uses source YES/NO/CANCEL and Escape-as-Cancel, temporarily
pausing and restoring prior pause. Native completion while the question is open
is deferred until the answer; completed errors hide Pause/Background and focus
the default Close button. Native message boxes use plain text. Their Qt platform
layout is checked separately from the 26-control source resource; macOS ignores
message-box window titles. Source MB_YESNOCANCEL and success MB_OK have no icon
flags: both Qt boxes use NoIcon; MB_ICONERROR uses Critical. Cancel's existing
normal/compact answer matrix checks the public icon. Final-error/success reports
request480×200/320×200, but native QMessageBox auto-fit determines actual sizes;
these requests do not establish two distinct rendered sizes. On Windows all
four progress-report producers and Cancel use the native QPA/font database,
as the main dialog already does. The offscreen plugin's missing-font fallback
metrics are unsuitable for application geometry. Add in an open archive was the first operation consumer
under P0-10.1. P0-10.2 connects the other current archive, filesystem and volume
operations. Filesystem/volume workers expose cancellation and real background
priority, but Pause is disabled because they have no worker pause capability.

MessagesDialog.rc (`IDD_MESSAGES`) uses a two-column numbered/message list and
Close footer,456×176DLU initial client and resize/minimize/maximize capabilities
without context-help. Assigning a parent must preserve those source flags.
Close has initial focus, matching the first resource tab stop.
The Qt source port preserves AddMessageDirect/AddMessage and the
OnInit/OnSize notification path; `IDL_MESSAGE` is above `IDOK` at 760×450 and
640×380. Current-build JSON confirms both controls are visible, separated and
within the dialog. Create follows the source modal lifetime until Close/Enter
(IDOK) or Escape (IDCANCEL), retaining the stack-owned PanelDrag message vector.
The independent File-menu journal was removed under P2-09. Font-DLU scaling
may enlarge the Close button to its Qt size hint. Windows rendered appearance
remains unverified.

### Redesign: shared form and diagnostic layout (2026-10-18)

The approved [redesign](../ui-redesign-plan.md) replaces presentation geometry
for Combo and Messages with a shared content/footer layout. Combo retains its
label above the editable history control, raw accepted value, initial selection
and Cancel semantics; initial height fits content instead of a resource-height
spacer. Long prompts wrap without covering the input or actions. Both dialogs
use the project outer/footer spacing with native control size hints. Messages
retains numbered rows, modal result codes, Close default/focus and font-scaled
initial report capacity. Its list grows while the footer remains visible.
This is an intentional layout adaptation; other source-based dialog contracts
remain unchanged. Evidence and checked platforms are in the
[redesign audit](../upstream-port-audit/ui-redesign.md).
No Windows rendered reference; geometry does not establish pixel parity.
The original IconID branch loads the exact FM.ico through a Qt ID/resource
service, including native 16/32/48 frames; default negative IDs preserve the
existing icon. Image decoding tests do not verify Windows title-bar rendering.

When extending a view, update its specification and add the relevant geometric
relationship or conditional state to its focused test. Add contracts for other
views as they are changed rather than rewriting all UI tests at once.

Create compression method states follow pinned CompressDialog.cpp/.h/.rc:
Store has empty dictionary/order/solid selectors, with threads still available
according to the original no-method policy. TAR GNU/POSIX has empty numeric and
thread selectors and hides both memory rows. GZip has its single Auto dictionary
and no threads/solid choices. An unrecognized external method retains empty
dictionary/order and unknown memory values; it does not borrow Copy's zero.
Empty selectors remain visible and disabled. Returning to ordinary 7z restores
the choices and memory rows. The two memory QWidget wrappers are presentation
containers, not additional resource groups. `compression_method_state` probes
EN/RU at760×720/640×480, reaches each field by scrolling and writes28 JSON reports.
These establish conditional visibility, row order, text fit and footer geometry;
original rendered Windows appearance remains unverified.

Create validation messages retain the original native call policy: password,
Browse/path and invalid-volume errors use MyMessages' suppressible Critical/OK
box with the 7-Zip caption; memory refusal uses unconditional Critical/OK, and
the small-volume question uses unconditional Yes/No/Cancel. Qt/macOS omits the
message-box caption. `compression_error_policy` checks EN/RU at requested
480×220/320×160 with Qt auto-fit, full label text and reachable buttons. These
standard platform boxes have no separate CompressDialog.rc control group.
Their JSON is geometry evidence; rendered original Windows appearance and native
desktop input remain separate acceptance requirements.
