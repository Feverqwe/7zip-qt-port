## Redesign: Extract form

The [approved redesign](../ui-redesign-plan.md) replaces the fixed columns with
one form: destination/history and browse, optional subfolder name, overwrite mode,
optional password, then Advanced settings. Path mode and root-folder duplication
remain effective when Advanced settings is collapsed. A short Modified indicator
identifies nondefault hidden options; expanded fields have no value summary.
Windows security is shown only on Windows.

A supplied password enables/reveals its section. Disabling the section excludes
the password from the accepted request and retains its draft for re-enabling.
Changing sections or browsing does not recreate controls or lose pending values.
Source modes/force flags, history normalization, metadata bool-pair precedence,
confirmation and Cancel persistence are unchanged. The primary action is Extract;
the native button box preserves its roles and live translations.
[Source scope and checks](../upstream-port-audit/ui-redesign.md).

### Rendered Add/Extract reference (P3-06, 2026-10-15)

Add's compact form reserves a separate gutter for its non-transient scroll bar;
it must not cover fields or fade while scrolling is required. Native/translated
minimum widths include that gutter. The bar reaches the right window edge;
the source right margin separates it from the form, and footer buttons retain
their right inset. `source_compress_dialog::scrollBarKeepsItsOwnSpace`
checks EN/RU native and simulated overlay styles, compact top/bottom states and
expansion without scrolling. Cocoa640-wide requests may grow to651 for Russian
labels; the footer stays exposed and Parameters remains reachable.
[Correction and checks](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-add-scroll-2026-10-15.md).

Rendered Add/Extract reference is separately available for original EN/RU initial
states. Its fixed desktop geometry is not a compact resize contract; Qt keeps
standard platform metrics and exposes compact Add content through scrolling with
a visible footer. Current native Add/Extract consumers supply12 JSON per OS;
Mac Extract may expand470-wide requests to554×343. [Reference/scope](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-03-2026-10-15.md#p3-03p3-06--rendered-addextract-and-native-layout-consumers-2026-10-15).

### Changed nested archive Parent (P3-05.15)

Parent uses the source modified-archive Yes/No/Cancel question. No and Cancel
both exit and delete the spool without changing the outer archive. Yes updates
the original outer item; writer failure/Cancel retains the modified spool and
reports the source update error, but still returns to the outer folder.
Parent ignores its final Refresh HRESULT. Failed publication leaves an empty,
enabled list; Ctrl+R recovers that same outer provider. Check native2/301-row
outer archives with disk-extracted children, both panes, EN/RU, table/icon and selection modes using representative
cases at980×620/640×400. Peer bytes/provider and subsequent filesystem OnTimer
must survive. These checks do not establish rendered Windows parity.

### Native nested opening (P3-05.15)

OpenItemInArchive keeps original preferred provider stream, bounded memory
extraction and disk extraction paths. Native provider streams use original Agent
index mapping and keep the module/resource alive while read or seek is possible.
All successful opens ignore the subsequent Refresh result as upstream does;
S_FALSE/E_FAIL/E_ABORT during child row publication must not add a dialog.
Failed publication is empty/enabled; Ctrl+R restores the same child provider.
Parent restores the original outer provider/focused child name and removes its
owned spool. Source timer/notify/redraw remain usable, including filesystem
navigation and OnTimer afterwards. Check2/301 child rows, both panes, EN/RU,
table/icon and standard/alternative selection at980×620/640×400. Inspect failed
and recovered address/list groups; original archives and peer bytes stay intact.
Native open cancellation must retain the outer provider/rows and release owned
temporary files without a stale refresh or extra error. Rendered Windows and
native Windows/Linux execution remain separate acceptance requirements.

### Open archive picker (P2-01)

File → Open archive… opens the native OS file picker. Its shortcut is Cmd+O
on macOS and Ctrl+O on Windows/Linux. This user-requested extension supplements
source Open/Open Inside and address navigation; the original IDM_MENU has no
independent archive picker command.

The picker starts in the current filesystem folder or the open archive's
containing folder. Archive masks come from native handler metadata, followed by
All files; without metadata only All files is offered. Cancel preserves the
current location. Accepted files use the existing archive opening, password and
error workflow. The command is unavailable during blocking archive operations
and modal dialogs. EN/RU normal/compact File-menu geometry is covered by
`shell_menu_window`, along with Unicode/spaces selection, cancel and invalid-file
handling. `browse_dialog` and `codec_catalog` cover reusable filters. Native OS
panels and physical shortcuts require separate platform acceptance.

For long/super paths the original custom Browse fallback retains its top
Parent/Create/folder row, three-column list, path edit, conditional filter and
OK/Cancel footer. Its source initial client is272×336DLU, with8DLU margins/gaps,
exact24DLU top-button widths with16DLU minimum height and64×16DLU footer
buttons with native caption protection. Path/filter heights have14DLU minimums.
Hidden FolderMode filter retains its vacant row; Cocoa uses its actual widget
rectangle to preserve that source space. It requests source minimize/maximize/
resize without context-help. Source demonstration rows initialize column widths
through content autosizing, including the native icon slot.
`source_browse_dialog` checks the initial EN/RU frame and visible controls;
existing normal/compact navigation/filter/create/accept/Cancel tests remain.
Parent/Create activate on Return/keypad Enter; Create cancellation leaves the
filesystem unchanged. Initial focus remains the path edit. Bounded original
EN/RU and current native results are in the
[browser receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-source-browsers-2026-10-16.md).

### Source extraction prompts (P0-04.1 prerequisite)

`extract_prompt` produces OverwriteDialog reports at 700×440 / 560×440 with
extra buttons enabled/disabled, and MemDialog reports at 700×460 / 560×460 with
limit editing disabled/enabled. `ui_parity_overwrite` / `ui_parity_mem` run
that current-build producer fixture before comparing pinned RC contracts.

The redesign places existing/incoming file details side by side beneath the
destination notice, with shared dialog margins and a compact footer aligned right.
Replace/Replace all/Auto rename and Skip/Skip all/Cancel retain all six source
result IDs. When batch answers are disallowed they are hidden and the remaining
actions share one row. Source ReduceString, byte size and timestamp formatting
are preserved. Skip is the default when No is requested by the source.
Widths follow native text hints rather than fixed ratios; details start beside
the top of each icon. The earlier gallery's disabled extra actions are superseded
by this redesign, restoring the source's visibility condition.
`overwrite_layout` covers EN/RU, normal/compact widths, extra-action availability
and reinitialization. Its initial-frame case checks readable controls at
8pt and 12pt fonts. Responsive Qt layouts and
native font metrics are deliberate adaptations of the fixed Win32 dialog;
they do not imply identical pixel dimensions. Rendered reference evidence is
recorded in the [P3-06 audit](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-2026-10-15.md).
Qt supplies one file icon; the optional second Windows EXE/ICO icon is omitted
explicitly in the contract. Widths must fit labels and footer buttons without
clipping. Default and native result IDs are checked behaviorally.

Memory sizes its initial client to visible content, using the shared dialog
margins/footer. The message is top-aligned; message and Action follow their content.
The limit edit/spinner pair occupies50DLU with native minimum protection,
with both arrow buttons fitting within the edit height,
indented below its controlling checkbox; GB follows the pair. Continue/Cancel
use native caption metrics. The source has no minimize/
maximize/context-help title-bar buttons.
Memory order is requirement/limit/RAM message, Allow/Skip action group,
change-limit checkbox, independent edit/spinner and GB label, Remember,
then Continue/Cancel. Source RAM-dependent default and spinner range,
text validation, NeedSave/Remember/SkipArc and cancellation are preserved.
The text field remains independent of the spinner range, including source
acceptance of zero; invalid text does not close the dialog.
Invalid-limit errors use source MyMessages' Critical/OK and 7-Zip title, with
user-question suppression; macOS hides QMessageBox titles. The pending dialog
and raw text remain available for correction in either policy state.
Qt spinner buttons adapt the original edit/up-down pair, preserving
the original `UDS_ALIGNRIGHT` paired width and `UDS_ARROWKEYS` keyboard path:
enabled buddy edit ↑/↓ invokes the same step operation as the buttons; disabled
input is unchanged. Up/down buttons are not independent tab stops. The raw text
parser and source range policy remain separate. Native button-box optical
margins may shift its backing widget by one pixel; source footer gaps are
asserted through public layout-item geometry, with actual control visibility
checked separately. This corresponds to Qt's
[QWidgetItem rectangle conversion](https://github.com/qt/qtbase/blob/6.12/src/widgets/kernel/qlayoutitem.cpp#L456).
These checks establish
structure and local Qt usability. Initial focus is Change allowed limit, as in
the first source tab stop. Native PanelOpen integration is checked in P0-04.1.
The bounded EN/RU original/current rendered comparison is recorded in the
[source-prompts receipt](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit/p3-06-source-prompts-2026-10-16.md);
whole workflow and pixel equality are not established by those initial views.

```sh
./scripts/build.sh dev ui_geometry_tests
ctest --preset dev -R '^ui_geometry$' --output-on-failure
```

CTest writes reports to `build/dev/ui-reports/`. `tests/layout_inspection.h`
also supports other Qt tests through `UiInspection::writeReport(widget, tag)`.
`SEVENZIP_UI_REPORT_DIR` overrides the output directory; standalone test runs
default to `ui-reports/` in the current directory. `ui_layout`, `extract_dialog`,
and `compression_preferences` now write JSON instead of mandatory PNGs.
Older screenshot-producing tests have not all been migrated.

Each JSON object contains class, object name, visible/enabled state, bounds in
root coordinates (`[x,y,width,height]`), exposed bounds after ancestor clipping,
size hint, and nested children in Qt object order. Static labels, button text,
group titles, and noneditable combo selections are included. Editable values
are omitted, including passwords in show-password mode. Static labels can still
contain generated paths; reports use disposable fixtures and are local artifacts.
Object-tree order is not tab order: use geometry for spatial relationships.

`fullyVisible` checks ancestor clipping, not occlusion by another sibling or
window. `separate` checks specified pairs; container/child overlap is intentional.
`labelFits` uses Qt size hints/height-for-width, not pixel analysis. Scrolled
content can be clipped until brought into view. Avoid blanket overlap or
visibility assertions on the entire widget tree.

For an unresolved rendering question:

```sh
SEVENZIP_CAPTURE_SCREENSHOTS=1 ctest --preset dev -R '^ui_geometry$' --output-on-failure
```

This writes optional PNGs next to the JSON. Open only the affected screenshot.

## Extract dialog

Reference: upstream commit `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
`CPP/7zip/UI/GUI/ExtractDialog.rc`, desktop `IDD_EXTRACT`.
Implemented view: `src/CPP/7zip/UI/GUI/ExtractDialog.cpp`.

- Destination label and editable history occupy the top; Browse is on the right.
- Below the destination, the left column contains the optional folder-name
  row, path mode, root-duplication checkbox, and overwrite mode in that order.
  The password group is right of the modes, with Password and Show Password.
  Restore file security is below it; Unix disables it with a platform reason.
- The folder-name field stays visible when its checkbox is cleared, but becomes
  disabled and does not contribute to the destination. Toggling preserves its
  pending text and the positions of the other controls.
- OK, Cancel and Help stay visible,
  distinct, and inside the window at requested sizes 640×360 and 470×330;
  Qt may expand to its style-dependent minimum size. Static labels fit.

P2-07 source_extract_advanced additionally checks EN/RU700×390/600×340 exposed
controls, checkbox width and source grouping/order. Four JSON reports reviewed
2026-10-03: compact modes are286 pixels wide, Russian ElimDup requires285;
inspected bounds equal exposedBounds. Rendered Windows parity is unverified.

The source caller supplies the full single-archive path in the window caption;
multiple archives use the plain Extract caption. Language changes preserve
that path and pending input. Eliminate duplication remains enabled independently
of the caller. The source resource has no destination hint.

`dialog_path_rules` adds EN/RU × split on/off Create/Extract Cancel/confirm
reports at 700×390/600×340 (Extract) and 760×720/640×480 (Create).
It asserts complete destination, mode, password, duplication and visible
folder-name fields, archive-name input and footer exposure. Source grouping and
conditional folder-name availability remain as above. Editable values are checked
by the workflow, not inferred from redacted JSON; native separators and NBSP
preservation change values without introducing controls or captions.

Current 2026-10-07 toolbar, language and advanced Extract/Copy reports were
reviewed on macOS, native Windows Qt and Linux. The mode/password columns,
checkbox text and footer remain exposed at normal/compact sizes. Requested
Russian470×330 expands to the style-dependent minimum (macOS525, Windows483
pixels wide). The standalone Windows GUI consumer also checks public UIA
exposure/enabled states and source caption. This does not establish original
Win32 pixel parity; [the audit](../archive/qt-port/upstream-port-audit.md#p3-05--toolbar-extracttest-source-consumers-2026-10-07)
owns the platform evidence.

Adaptations: the pinned desktop resource and Qt use combo boxes for modes.
Help uses the source topic. The blank folder-name checkbox uses an accessible
tooltip; Qt layouts and platform button ordering replace Win32 positioning.
See `docs/7zfm-parity.md` for
behavioral limitations. The tests check these relationships rather than hardcoded
pixel coordinates or native button ordering.

## Archive password prompt

Reference: upstream `0766b733fe3e06dd2a7f9a3cfbf2108ac73abd17`,
`CPP/7zip/UI/FileManager/PasswordDialog.cpp/.h/.rc` (`IDD_PASSWORD`).
`CPasswordDialog` shows a prompt, password edit, Show Password, then Continue/Cancel.
The redesign uses shared dialog margins/footer, a content-sized initial height
and native control/button metrics and ordering. The source has no minimize,
maximize or context-help title-bar buttons. Compact Qt resize remains an
accessibility adaptation of the fixed original form.
Initial focus is the password edit. Initial Password/ShowPassword are applied before display. Toggling copies the
current edit into public state, then changes echo mode without changing its text,
as in ReadControls/SetTextSpec. OK/Enter commit raw text; the caller discards a
rejected dialog and keeps the existing backend cancellation policy.

`password_dialog` checks masked/shown states at 360×170 and 260×170, control
order, label fitting, footer visibility and separation. `ui_parity_password`
maps all five resource controls to these current-build reports. Behavioral tests
cover initial values, Unicode/spaces, show/hide, OK/Enter and Cancel. Editable
password values stay out of reports. Russian captions and Qt button ordering
are documented adaptations. Windows rendering remains unverified.

`password_window` adds current-build 360×170/260×170 reports for accepted
Unicode, surrounding spaces and empty text during source archive opening.
It also checks the subsequent asynchronous process prompt, raw-value reuse,
Cancel/reopen and reset on another archive. `open_callback`/`update_callback`
cover empty and supplementary Unicode through the portable UString/BSTR boundary.
These add caller coverage; the resource layout and labels are unchanged.
