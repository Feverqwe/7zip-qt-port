# Archive folder lifetime across rollback — 2026-10-18

Source: <https://github.com/ip7z/7zip.git>, commit
`9128b80e3a471108678e2b3ec3c985861c8d7b0f`.
Reviewed `CPP/7zip/UI/Agent/ArchiveFolderOut.cpp::CommonUpdateOperation`,
`Agent.cpp::ReOpen/Close`, `AgentProxy.cpp::CProxyArc2::Load/GetDirPathParts`,
and FileManager `App.cpp::OnCopy`, with the Qt transfer/rollback, reopen,
property transport and panel publication callers. The unchanged borrowed
module baseline remains recorded in `upstream-baseline.json`.

The source saves FolderItem before closing the handler and restores it after
reopening. The Qt interarchive Move rollback must additionally close the physical
reader before replacing the destination file. Its old bridge saved the folder
path after closing. On Windows the proxy can borrow UTF-16 names directly from
the native handler; reading those names after Close intermittently lost the ADS
folder and selection. On platforms with wider wchar_t the proxy copies these
names, which explains why the Windows failure did not reproduce on macOS.

The narrow close/reopen bridge now owns the path parts, ADS flag and folder
prefix before closing. Closed folders reject item access, while their saved path
remains available for reopening and selection restoration. The existing source
path walk and binding branches are retained; no format algorithm, update branch
or dependency is replaced or omitted. Upstream has no separate file-only
rollback bridge to copy. No upstream checkout or resource is changed.

The native folder opening regression now covers Close followed by ReOpen of a
Unicode ADS folder, including its path and contents. The existing peer-stream
Copy/Move scenario covers destination bytes, cancelled source deletion,
selection and subsequent operations. Its setup waits until the panel accepts
interaction; failures identify the operation stage and stop cascading actions.

Focused validation built the application and passed `native_folder_opening`,
`agent_stream_copy_ui`, `interarchive_recovery`, `panel_key_source`, `help_source`,
`help_ui` and `ui_layout` on macOS arm64, Linux x64 and Windows x64 / Qt 6.12.
Windows additionally passed three repeats each of peer-stream Copy/Move and
source keyboard tests. These cover a native Windows keyboard/recovery consumer;
the Help, icon geometry and peer-stream suites use their configured offscreen
platform. No full gate, opt-in slow suite or original Windows visual comparison
was run.

The other recorded failures were test synchronization/geometry assumptions:
Help waits for Qt's scroll-range publication, with a 60-second suite budget after
a measured successful Windows run of about 22 seconds; bookmark input waits for
an enabled list after navigation; icon cells may wrap when two do not fit the
viewport. Label/icon containment and non-overlap remain checked. These changes
do not alter product layout or key dispatch. Icon widget reports now survive
temporary fixture cleanup in the regular UI report directory.
The final `ui_layout` rerun passed on all three platforms after this report-path
change; current compact large-font widget JSON was reviewed on macOS and Windows.

## Retired interfaces and retained codec catalog

The subsequent lifetime review compared complete Agent close/reopen, proxy,
binding, extraction and update entry points with the same upstream revision,
including their panel text, sorting, properties and stream consumers. Upstream
FileManager releases its old folder interfaces around reopening; the Qt bridge
can retain them across rollback and asynchronous publication. The adapted owner
must therefore reject access through every retired interface.

Close now retires all published folders before releasing handler-owned names.
Fast name, prefix, size, comparison, ADS and stream entry points check the existing
binding generation, as do extraction and update entry points that previously
touched stale state before their common guard. Closed owners cannot publish a
fresh root backed by retired proxies. The initial-open diagnostic-folder branch
and its S_FALSE result remain preserved. No upstream proxy walk, sorting rule,
archive algorithm or dependency is replaced or omitted.

The Qt reopen adapter also retains the archive's original codec catalog instead
of consulting the backend's replaceable discovery result. The source opener
already receives its owning CCodecs; the existing Qt overload supplies that same
ownership boundary. A failing module discovery must not remove native WIM parent
and stream capabilities from an already open archive.

Expanded behavior regressions cover ZIP/WIM root and child interfaces in normal
and flat modes after Close, failed ReOpen and successful ReOpen, plus WIM reopen,
parent hierarchy, ADS support and extracted bytes after failed catalog replacement.
Before the fixes, all four closed-folder cases remained readable, and WIM reopen
after catalog replacement failed with E_NOTIMPL.

The application built and all 15 focused archive ownership, property, stream,
update/extract and interarchive recovery suites passed on macOS arm64, Linux x64
and Windows x64 with Qt 6.12. Partial AddressSanitizer builds of Agent.cpp,
ArchiveFolderOut.cpp and the lifecycle suite passed all eight cases on macOS and
Windows. Qt, codec modules and remaining dependencies were not instrumented.
Clang's static analyzer reported no findings for Agent.cpp. These checks validate
the selected lifecycle scenarios; no full gate, opt-in slow suite or visual
comparison was run for this nonvisual change.

## Item streams and property consumers — follow-up review

Reviewed the complete Qt item-stream wrapper, archive property transport,
native-property mapping, raw panel-property implementation and reopen adapter,
with resource/header owners, Agent GetStream and archive-to-archive transfer
callers. The wrapper retains its resource before native stream interfaces;
destruction releases those interfaces before the resource/catalog lease.
Raw property buffers belong to the retained metadata or native handler and
are consumed under its existing open/bound lifetime. Reopen replaces the
property binding after native metadata is available. The source update stream
is copied within the joined operation; source deletion and destination rollback
follow completion of that copy.

The source Agent GetStream and native TAR/FAT/NTFS/Ext stream constructors were
inspected at the revision above to distinguish retained input/handler references
from data validity after Close. Keeping a COM reference does not establish a
right to use a handler's invalidated data after explicit Close. No current
caller requiring that unsupported lifetime was established, and no speculative
stream snapshot or delayed-close policy was added. No new confirmed ownership
defect or omitted source branch was found in this selected scenario.

Existing agent_stream_update, agent_stream_copy_ui and native_archive_properties
passed together with verctrl on macOS arm64 (4/4, 7.20 s), Linux x64 (4/4,
6.77 s) and Windows x64 (4/4, 20.85 s), Qt 6.12, guest run
`20261018T134937Z-6240522b`. Filesystem ADS update rows remain Windows-only;
macOS/Linux skip those rows while exercising archive ADS. The targets rebuilt
incrementally with existing caches. No new production code/test, allocation
injection, standalone Qt reproducer, full/slow gate or visual acceptance was
part of this follow-up.
