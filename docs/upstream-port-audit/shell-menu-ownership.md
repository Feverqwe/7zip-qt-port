# Shell submenu ownership — 2026-10-18

Source: <https://github.com/ip7z/7zip.git>, commit
`9128b80e3a471108678e2b3ec3c985861c8d7b0f`.
Reviewed complete `CPP/7zip/UI/FileManager/PanelMenu.cpp::CreateSystemMenu`,
its CreateShellContextMenu/InvokePluginCommand callers and COM/PIDL owners;
`CPP/7zip/UI/Explorer/ContextMenu.cpp::QueryContextMenu`, MyAddSubMenu and
MyInsertMenu; and `CPP/Windows/Menu.h/.cpp` insertion/destroyer contracts.
Qt consumers include the portable menu tree, native tree renderer,
QtFileManagerShellMenu and native owner-draw/message presentation.

The copied system-menu body detached its popup and disabled CMenuDestroyer
before label construction and parent insertion. A refused insertion therefore
left the entire popup tree without an owner. The native Windows regression
actually reproduced six additional USER handles after three rejected insertions
(22 handles instead of the original 16). It warms the real shell providers,
passes an invalid parent to the public panel operation, checks process resource
balance and verifies that subsequent valid construction still works.

The original destroyer now remains armed until insertion succeeds. The same
source review found early release of the main portable popup and missing guards
for the Open/CRC submenu preparation. Those owners now transfer after successful
MyAddSubMenu. Command generation, IDs, branching, providers and invocation
remain in their original modules; no menu algorithm or command is replaced or
omitted. These are local ownership corrections to the copied source.

The Qt tree adapter previously adopted a raw child before the allocating vector
insertion. Its contract now matches native insertion: rejection or an exception
leaves the child with its caller; an accepted entry adopts it. The Windows tree
renderer likewise retains its original CMenuDestroyer through native insertion,
covering both returned failure and unwinding. Existing recursive destruction
releases the full unpublished tree, as specified by
[DestroyMenu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-destroymenu).
The regression uses
[GetGuiResources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getguiresources)
to observe the process's USER-handle balance, without pinning a shell menu's
structure or its initial resource count.

The returned native-failure case has runtime evidence. Exception paths are
reviewed from source; no allocation injection or standalone Qt reproducer is
part of this change. Menu layout, captions, command availability and visual
appearance are unchanged.

Focused acceptance after the complete ownership change: context_menu_settings,
shell_context, shell_menu_window and source_context_menu passed on macOS arm64
(4/4, 1.91 s) and Linux x64 (4/4, 3.16 s). Windows x64 additionally passed
native_system_menu, native_menu_presentation and native_shell_com
(7/7, 26.00 s). Guest evidence: `20261018T125513Z-50a6e4b1`, Qt 6.12.
The application also built on macOS. A subsequent application build on both
guests captured an unfinished parallel Add-dialog signature change and failed
there; run `20261018T125629Z-c58dd142` does not establish application acceptance.
The focused snapshot above predates that unrelated change. Persistent build
trees and compiler caches were reused. No full gate, slow suite or visual
acceptance was run.
